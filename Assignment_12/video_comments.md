# Evolution Group Meeting Summary
In the group meeting they started by going over dates and meeting changes. Then they began to go over pull requests. The first pull request they reviewed was the metric for Active Contributors. Most of the suggestions made were changing formatting and symantics of the file itself. As they went over the document they created a review for the person who subbmitted the pull request. The next metric they reviewed was the Code Length metric. They discussed if it was to similar to one of their other metrics, but also how it could be useful as a snapshot metric. This was essentially the last thing they did in this video.

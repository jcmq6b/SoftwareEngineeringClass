Risk Working Group

Podcast Reflection:

I found the podcast to be a great introduction to the chaoss project and really helpful at explaining the purpose of the project itself. It was interesting to see how it started with a small group of people who were interested in creating metrics to analyze the health of open source projects to it becoming this large community of people creating and reviewing new metrics for companies to use. These tools that are being created through this project will enable companies to make educated risk assesments on their projects, something that would most likely be much more difficult to do without these metrics.

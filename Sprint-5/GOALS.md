## Goals

### The purpose of my application:
- Is to be able to have the user be able to select a json file to edit (potentially also xml or text file as well), and have it presented to them in a readable and editable format.
- Allow the user to directly manipulate the json files on the website's server so that changes can be made through the webpage rather than downloading the file, editing, then reuploading to the server.
- The application's core audience would be web developers, or just users hosting a website. User that would like to easily change details stored in a json/xml/text file on their server to dynamically update their webpage.

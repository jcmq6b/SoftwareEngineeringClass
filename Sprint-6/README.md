### Whoops
- I think I might have submitted the wrong thing. It said 'Submit the commit of your first iteration from your github repository under the assginment'
- I'm not sure if that meant create a new assignment with your first iteration files, or if it meant just resubmit the link to the first iteration of your project....

- Either way here is the first iteration of my SSO project: https://github.com/jcmq6b/jcmq6b/tree/master/Assignment13-a
- My First Revision: https://github.com/jcmq6b/jcmq6b/tree/master/Sprint-5

### Current Revision:
- The new link is: http://ec2-3-83-96-252.compute-1.amazonaws.com/SSOLoginJSONEditor/
- My website is currently able to support sign-ons and remebers the user so they dont need to sign on again
- However, my logout isn't working, so when the user trys to go back to the default page they are left on a blank screen.

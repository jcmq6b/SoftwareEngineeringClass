# How To Run
Note: I couldn't figure out how to run the authentication portion from a non-local host (so sorry in advance since running it requires downloading my SSO project folder)

### Starting the server (it runs on localhost:3000 (you can probably run the server another way, but this is how I did it))
- Download the Auth0SSO folder
- Run terminal or command prompt from the Auth0SSO folder
- run the command: 'php -S localhost:3000'
- the server should start, just leave it running for now (command-C or ctrl-C to close the server)

### Viewing Web Applicaiton
- Go to your browser and put in the url: http://localhost:3000
- This should take you to the login page, sign in with google or sign up, either works
- After logging in you should be taken to the JSON Editor

### The JSON Editor Page
- This page is hosted on my AWS Server and not included in the Auth0SSO folder
- You can select the file and character to view the JSON data associated with it
- You also have the option to go to my Risk of Rain 2 Character Showcase webpage using the link at the bottom
- The logout button should direct you back to the sign in page.

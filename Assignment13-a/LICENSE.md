## Software License I would prefer to use for an open source project I create

I would most likely use the MIT license because it doesn't have really limiting conditions. Which means that I can change and use the open source software as long as the copyright notices are intact. Being unable to change and use the open source software without going through a million hoops sounds like a much better deal than the more restrictive licenses.

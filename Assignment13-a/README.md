##How my SSO works (or should)
- Right now it will only work on http://localhost:3000/ which requires me to have the server up and running using GitBash
- I run the server using: 'npm run dev' which runs 'nodemon server.js'
- The link should take you to a very basic page where theres just a greeting with a login and logout button below it
